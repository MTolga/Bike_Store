# Bike_Store_Query
The code is a SQL query that retrieves information from multiple tables in a database. The query uses JOIN operations to combine data from the tables "sales.orders", "sales.customers", "sales.order_items", "production.products", "production.categories", "sales.stores", and "sales.staffs".

The query selects a set of columns from the combined data, including the order ID, customer name, customer city, customer state, order date, total units sold, revenue, product name, category name, store name, and sales representative name.

The data is grouped by the selected columns, and the revenue is calculated by multiplying the quantity of each order item by its list price. The customer name and sales representative name are combined using the CONCAT function.

The result of the query is a set of rows, each representing an order and its associated customer, product, category, store, and sales representative information.
